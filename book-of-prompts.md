## 3D Simulations & Visualizations

### Sphere Packing Simulation (Three.js)

**Target AI:** V0  
**Application Type:** Next.js React Web Application  
**Date Added:** October 2025

**Prompt:**
```
Using nextjs react jsx only, please create a website for a 3JS simulation of a 3d square pyramid made out of blue spheres where the spheres are stacked, add nice lighting to the 3d display on a black background, this entire app should be an example for my portfolio to show that I can simulate 3d maths, add a header bar with glowing text that says "Sphere Packing Simulation" add a profile icon and a settings gear cog icon in the top right corner, the rest of the ui should be a nice black/dark dark grey color with orange accents and the entire thing should be very modern with rounded corners all over and nice Arial text. Please make the spheres touch each other instead of having space between the spheres and add a slider and button to animate them spreading apart vertically, and remove the bottom plate that they sit on. Please do a little math on the size of the spheres to ensure there are no gaps, I would like them to be flush.
```

**Key Features:**
- Three.js 3D visualization
- Blue sphere pyramid structure
- Modern dark UI with orange accents
- Portfolio-ready presentation
- Header with navigation icons

**Notes:**
- Good for demonstrating 3D mathematics capabilities
- Clean, modern aesthetic suitable for portfolios

### Modular Card-Based Chatbot Interface

**Target AI:** V0  
**Application Type:** Next.js React Web Application  
**Date Added:** October 2025

**Prompt:**
```
Using nextjs react jsx only, please create a chatbot interface where I can chat back and forth with my ai in a text bubble like format, and I would like it to have mockup messages to start with that I will change later. I would like the chat area to have rounded corners. I would like it to be a slidable card that I can move around, and I would like other cards that I can add such as an image upload card. I want the entire UI to be modular with these different cards. I would like to have a bar at the top that shows the profile icon and a settings gear cog icon and I would also like in the top left a glowing chatbot title, the title should glow golden and the rest of the ui should be a nice black/dark dark grey color with golden accents and the entire thing should be very modern with rounded corners all over and nice Arial text
```

**Key Features:**
- Modular card-based UI system
- Draggable/slidable cards
- Text bubble chat format
- Image upload capability
- Modern dark UI with golden accents
- Mockup messages for testing

**Notes:**
- Highly flexible modular design
